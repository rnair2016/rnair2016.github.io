      <p>Two of these paintings have a story associated with it. How do I know? Because these were the childhood stories that my parents would tell me. These paintings are Done by a king in India specifically a place called "Thiruvithamkoor" during the times my Great grandparents were in their teen years. My great grandmother still tells me of the great paintings he had made and shows me the one she has from the king himself.Raja Ravi Varma's painting's always have a touch of realism to them, making you want to merge with the painting itself. The phot below is a photo of Raja Ravi Varma. The third painting was done by none other than Leonardo DaVinci. I love his paintings because they look really realistic. His photo is down below as well. The last one is done by an artist named Salvador Dalí. His painting is the only abstract painting that I have loved so far in my life. That is also why he is one of my favorite artists. He is crazy, and knows he is. His photo is down below as well.</p>

        <h3>Lady With Lamp</h3>
      <p>I like this work by King Raja Ravi Varma because it portrays not only the Indian women but it also shows the light that glows representing hope, in everyone's hearts.Another reason I like this piece of work is because because the lamp she is holding shows the type of girl she is. Lighting a lamp shows that you believe in god. Lighting a lamp helps with concentrating on that flame and meditating to unite yourself with the conciousness in everything. This painting has shown everything that a proper girl would do. The way he has drawn the sari of the woman is incredible because he has paid so much attention to all of the creases and folds that a sari would normally make.Finally the last thing I would like to pint out about the painting is the shadows that he has made.</p>

        <h3>Damayanti</h3>
      <p> I admire this painting because of the story that is behind it. In this picture Damayanti is listening to the swan talking about Nala. Damayanti is a princess that has beauty and grace. She loves hearing about the Nala. She falls in love with him with just hearing about his greatness. Even the gods were looking upon Damayanti. On the day of her Choosing Ceremony, The gods: Indra, Agni, Yama, and Varuna send for Nala. They want to use Nala as a messenger to tell Damayanti to choose one of them. But Nala says that he himself is interested in her. the gods persuade him being who they are, and Nala agrees to go on the mission. When Nala reaches her and tells her about the condition, she agrees that she will pay her respects to the gods but, she will only choose Nala as her husband. When the gods came, they disguised themsleves as Nala. But Damayanti sees through them. She says sorry, and that she will only choose Nala as a husband. So the gods turned back and started going back when they meet the demon kali. He also wants to marry damayanti but the gods tell him the condition they are in. Kali gets really made aand makes a vow promising that he will be the cause of Nala's kingdom's fall.</p>

      <h3>Mona Lisa</h3>
      <p>I adore this piece of artwork because of the mystery that still intrigues scientists and artists even today. Leanardo DaVinci has created many amazing pieces of artwork that many people all over the world adore, but I have a special liking towards this one because of how annoyed someone can get not knowing whether she is smiling or not.</p>

        <h3>The Persistance of Memory</h3>
        <p>I usually do not like abstract art work because if my sister who is in thrid grade tries hard enough she can make one too. All she has to do is make up some meaning that she thinks is in the artwork and ....poof.... it is art. I really like this piece because the guy that painted this Salvador Dalí based this off of Einsteins theory of relativity. When i first understood in simple words, what Einsteins theory was about I imagined what it would look like and I kind of imagined objects like what Salvador had drawn. I like his creativity in this drawing and admire the way he drew this, by not making it so that it looks really abstract, but having it fit into the category.</p>
