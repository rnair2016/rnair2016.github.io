      <p>In this website I have put my two favorite pieces of work from all of the units we have learned. I chose these pieces because these were the assignments I had put a lot of effort into, during the beginning of the year. I learned how to change the background on images, put new backgrounds in, and much more. I also learned how to digitally design using gimp. After the image manipulation unit we learned how to code using 4 different languages: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a litle bit of Javascript. In that unit, the websites that I was the most proud of, were the ones I had made for the round robin. After that unit, we learned how to 3D model using blender. This was one of my favorite units because I was really happy that I could mould something into a whole different object. During the beginning of the unit I had struggled with making the snowman, but I got more used to it as we progressed, and it turned out to be my favorite unit. The hardware identification unit was a unit mixed with html coding and 3D modeling. I learned how computers work and why they stop working at times. I also learned how the inside of a computer is supposed to be assembled and learned the names of the different parts inside a computer. Finally during the Unreal unit we had made a mars biosphere to show our skills we had aquired working with unreal for about a week. I learned how to make landscapes, add textures, and also how to import and export objects in and out of unreal. When I am in eighth grade, I want to be able to code confidently in Javascript, and be able to work more on 3D modeling.</p>
