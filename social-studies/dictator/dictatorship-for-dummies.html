                 <br>
                 There were many types of dictators who have set their feet in this world. All of them had at least one thing in common. They were all made into the people that they all became because of the environment that they were surrounded by. Finding an environment that can make a person a dictator is one of the hardest things. One can become an absolute ruler only if he is living in a country that is desperate enough to welcome one in. A dictator would have the ability to manipulate people’s mind and be able to persuade them. There should exist a suitable environment that can bring up a dictator. The environmental factors can be economical, political, and social.
                 <br><br>
                 To begin with, a country that is in economical ruins can be a growing environment for an absolute ruler. One reason that Adolf Hitler, got to reign over Germany was because of the poor economy that it had, so did Josef Stalin in Russia. When a country has a poor economy the people in that country are also very poor. For example, once WWI was over, the Treaty of Versailles was made and Germany had to make reparations and had to pay an extensive amount of money, which they could not afford at all. In the Article German Economy in the 1920’s, it says, “Faced with reparation payments they could not afford, Germany began printing exaggerated amounts of money. This threw Germany into a state of hyperinflation. Inflation reached the point where millions of marks were worthless” (2003). This shows how desperate the Germans were because of the German economy at that time. Another reason why a poor country would mould a dictator into shape is because the people of that country would do anything to get back up on their feet. When one person promises the people to do something different to help the economy, then people will obviously go with that person. People will start believing him and vote for him just because they want to see that something different is happening. Hence economical factors can be a great cause for bringing up a dictator.
                 <br><br>
                 Another environment that can be suitable for a dictator to grow is a politically unstable or anti-people government. Forming a bad bond between the people and the government for an acceptable reason would be the dictator’s first job. For example in Germany, Hitler formed a hatred towards the newly formed government named the Weimar Republic. In the article World War I: Aftermath, it says, “...rampant conviction among many in the general population that Germany had been ‘stabbed in the back’ by the ‘November criminals’ — those who had helped to form the new Weimar government and broker the peace which Germans had so desperately wanted, but which had ended so disastrously in the Versailles Treaty” (2016). This quote shows how much the people hate Weimar Republic, calling them “November criminals” and stating that they had stabbed the people from behind them. Hitler believed that these people were Jewish politicians. If one wants to become a dictator he needs to get rid of any other political party and make sure that only the dictator’s party is standing. Hitler’s first task when he became the dictator of Germany was to get rid of all of the other political parties so that there would be no one to speak out against him. So the political factor is another environmental factor that can bring up a dictator.
                 <br><br>
                 Finally, a country that has several social problems can also be a growing environment for a dictator. The people in a country who has many social problems would be really vulnerable and easy to manipulate. When a country has many social problems, the people will be looking for someone or something to blame it on. Hitler had made the Jews a scapegoat for many of Germany's problems. Hitler promised the people of Germany that he would bring back the Germany to its previous pride. In the article 1933: Hitler comes to power, it says, “The Nazis (short for National Socialists) promised to stop reparation payments, to give all Germans jobs and food, and to make them proud to be German again. And they blamed Jews for most of Germany's problems” (2016). This quote shows why the people of Germany would want Hitler to come to power. When Hitler looked around, he noticed that many of the high class businessmen were “people who couldn’t see past their noses”. He didn’t like that the Jews were getting ahead of the working class Germans and decided to make that a social topic. He made sure to state in all of his speeches that the Jews were the cause to all of Germany’s troubles. This made people hate the Jews, and wanted Hitler to become their leader because he promised them that he would put an end to their problems. This is how a social factor can bring up a dictator.
                 <br><br>
                 Almost every dictator became so because of the environment that they were living in. The wanting to fix the problems going on in their surroundings played a factor in their dictatorship. A dictator will be  persuasive and trustworthy to the people till he is elected as their leader by them. However the dictatorship can not last for a long time as the people will realize the bad effect of it sooner or later. The economic, political and social reasons will help only in giving birth to a dictatorship. Those factors will not help in continuing it for long. So to conclude, any of the three factors (economic, political or social) can be the cause of a person becoming a dictator.
